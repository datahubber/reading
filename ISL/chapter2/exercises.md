1. (a) Large n small p: A flexible method is better because it's unlikely to overfit due to large sample size.
   (b) Small n large p: An inflexible method is betterto avoid overfit.
   (c) Non-linear: Flexible method are better as they can model complex, non-linear relationships more effectively.
   (d) high error variance: Inflexible method is better as they are less likely to overfit.

2. (a) regression. inference, because we want to figure out the relationship between CEO salary and other factors.
   (b) classification. prediction, because we want to know whether this product will be successful in the future, if not, we wouldn't launch it.
   (c) regerssion. prediction, because we want to predict the trend and make money.

4. (a)credit card approval. response: whether or not approve, predictors: balance, credit history. prediction
   cancer detection. response: whether or not is cancer. predictors: image size, bmi. prediction
   e-mail recommendation. response: whether or not send him this e-mail. predictors: historical data. prediction
    (b)stock prediction. response: price. predictors: volume, volatile. prediction.
   life expectation. response: age. predictors: wealth, race, bmi. prediction.
   insurance fee. response: price. predictors: accident history, age. prediction.
   (c)group industries according to their characteristics.
   group consumers and give different pricing options.
   market segmentation in marketing.

5. Flexible methods are preferred when the relationship is complex and sufficient data is available. Inflexible methods are better when the relationship is simple or data is limited.
advantages of a felxible approach is that it can capture the complex relationship between factors and response, reduce the error. the disadvantage is that might be overfitting, can't capture the universe relationship.
  When the factors number is big, it's better to use a flexible approach.

6. Parametric involves assumptions about the form of the function. They are simpler, faster, and require less data, but ma be biased if the functional form is incorrect.
